# Dave's Burgers Database Queries 🍔💻

This repository contains SQL queries for Dave's Burgers' orders table. The queries aim to find an interesting note left on an order in the 'special_instructions' tab. These notes are being considered for inclusion in an upcoming marketing campaign! 🎉

## Queries 🕵️‍♂️📝

The queries in this repository are designed to dive deep into the orders table for Dave's Burgers. Initially, we're grabbing a snapshot of recent orders and identifying the most recent date to stay on top of incoming data. Then, we take a look at the 'special_instructions' from the first 20 orders and pull out all non-empty ones for closer examination. To make it easier to navigate, we've also sorted these instructions alphabetically.

Interesting patterns start to emerge when we search for specific terms within the instructions. We've dug into the special instructions that contain the words 'sauce', 'door', and 'box', shedding light on customer preferences from extra condiments to delivery instructions and personalized packaging. We've also mapped specific requests to orders using the word 'box' for improved readability.

One particular query stands out: we're retrieving information about the order that asked for a 'narwhal drawing on the delivery box', because, frankly, it's too unique to ignore. A combination of these queries will help us find the perfect, interesting note for Dave's Burgers' upcoming marketing campaign. 🍔💡
